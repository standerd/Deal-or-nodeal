Game Rules:

The object of the game is to get the banker to offer you more
money then what you have in the suitcase that you selected.

As the game progresses the bankers offer will change depending on
the values that are in the remaining cases.

The main goal is to try and pick suitcases with the smallest
values inside them. This way you will obtain higher offers from
the bank.

1. On the first screen please select your case.
2. On the second screen you will be shown a heading indicating how
   many suitcases you are to select in the round. This number will
   reduce as you select cases to indicate how many cases are
   remaining in the current round.
3. Once the remaing suitcases reach 0, a page will display where
   the banker will offer you a sum of money for your suitcase.
4. You can either accept his offer or reject his offer and continue
   with the game.
5. The suitcases that you need to select will reduce in each round
   and be indicated in the heading.
6. Once you reach only 1 case remaining and you still decline the
   bankers offer. You will win whatever value was contained inside
   the suitcase that you had selected.
7. GOOD LUCK
